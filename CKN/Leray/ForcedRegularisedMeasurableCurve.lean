# Measurable curves of `L²` classes from jointly measurable fields

A jointly measurable field `Γ(x, s)` with square-integrable slices defines a
curve `s ↦ [Γ(·, s)]` of `L²` classes. Its distance to any fixed class is a
measurable function of `s` by Tonelli, and in a separable metric space this
already makes the curve measurable. This is the measurability used for the
force and Stokes Duhamel integrands of `lem:regularised-forced`.
